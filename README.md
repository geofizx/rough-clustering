# Python Implementations of Clustering Using Rough Sets

###Description
    Rough clustering for integer features - See /code/README_rough_sets
    Rough k-means clustering for float features - See /code/README_rough_kmeans

####Input

    Both algorithms take as input a dictionary with <feature_name> : list pairs (float/integer features)

####Usage

    /tests/rough_clustering_tests.py - example usage and tests for known 2-class clustering problem in UCI Statlog Data
    set for credit risk

    /tests/rough_kmeans_tests.py - example usage and tests for known 4-class clustering problem
